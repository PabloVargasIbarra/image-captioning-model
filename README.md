# Image Captioning Deep Learning Model

You can see me programming in the balcony of my home. We have developed the deep learning algorithm that has described the image. 
The results are far from perfect but it is amazing how a model can understand the content and create a caption.

The model combines Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing ideas. First, transfer learning
through the Inception V3 network, this network embeds the input image using convolutional layers. 
Secondly, a recurrent network with long-short-term memory layers generates the sequence of words that describes the image.

This repository includes:
 
 - a notebook with the model implemented step by step with Tensorflow
 - weights trained that generate relatively good results 
 - different examples where the model success and fail
 
The ideas and the code come mainly from the final project of Coursera course [Introduction to Deep Learning. HSE.](https://www.coursera.org/learn/intro-to-deep-learning)
